## What is Hepatic Encephalopathy?

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome resulting from liver dysfunction, typically associated with liver cirrhosis. It is characterized by a wide spectrum of cognitive and motor impairments, ranging from subtle deficits detectable only through specialized testing to severe confusion, coma, and even death.

## What is PHES?

The **Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES)** is a standardized set of neuropsychological tests designed to assess and quantify **Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy (MHE)**. It is widely regarded as the gold standard for MHE diagnosis.

### Components of PHES:
PHES includes **five paper-and-pencil tests** that assess various cognitive domains:
1. **Number Connection Test-A (NCT-A)**: Measures attention and psychomotor speed.
2. **Number Connection Test-B (NCT-B)**: Evaluates task-switching ability and executive function.
3. **Digit Symbol Test (DST)**: Tests processing speed and visuospatial functions.
4. **Serial Dotting Test (SDT)**: Assesses motor skills and speed.
5. **Line Tracing Test (LTT)**: Evaluates motor coordination and accuracy.

### Scoring:
- Each test is scored individually based on the time taken or errors committed.
- Raw scores are compared against normative data (adjusted for age and education).
- The final **PHES score** is derived by summing the deviations of test scores from the normative range. A negative total score indicates cognitive impairment.

### 目标:
- 使用PC和移动端设备进行PHES；
- 基于传统PHES，探索适合移动端设备操作的HE诊断工具；
